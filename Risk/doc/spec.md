Global description: **Effect of uncertainty on objectives. An effect is a deviation from the expected—positive and/or negative. Objectives can have different aspects (such as financial, health and safety, and environmental goals) and can apply at different levels (such as strategic, organization-wide, project, product and process). Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events and consequences, or a combination of these. Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an event (including changes in circumstances) and the associated likelihood of occurrence. Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information related to, understanding or knowledge of, an event, its consequence, or likelihood.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `affects`: Array of URIs related to the area in which the risk could affect.  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `consequence`: The consequence caused by a risk materialization. Enum:'quality, quantity, reputation'  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: The risk description in a natural language  - `event`: Occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances. Enum:'destruction, interruption, manipulation, pollution'  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `isOutputOf`: Array of URIs of the different Geospatial Data Layers  - `linkTo`: Array of URIs related to the Mitigation Measures.  - `location`:   - `mitigatedBy`: Array of URIs related to the Mitigation Measures.  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `severity`: The impact generated by the associated Risk. Enum:'LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH'  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `sourceRisk`: Array of URIs related to the source of the Risk that can be a Person, a Digital System, etc.  - `threat`: The potential cause of an incident that may result in a breach of information security or compromise business operations. Enum:'cyber, cyber-physical, physical'  - `type`: NGSI-LD Entity Type. It must be equal to Risk.  - `validFrom`: The time at which the risk materialization is finished.  - `validTo`: The time at which the risk materialization is started.
