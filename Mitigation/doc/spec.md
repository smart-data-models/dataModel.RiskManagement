Global description: **The mitigation of consequences reduces the risk after an event has occurred. Therefore, this risk reduction measure is not suitable for the reduction of the likelihood of events but for the reduction of the negative consequences. Examples for consequence mitigation measures could be e.g. the construction of connection pipes to the neighbor water supplier(s) to get water from them in case of a breakdown of the own water supply, the construction of wells for an emergency supply or signing of contracts with organizations providing small mobile emergency water treatment plants.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `affects`: Array of URIs related to the area in which the risk could affect.  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `apply`: Array of URIs related to Measures associated to the mitigation.  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `consequence`: The consequence caused by a risk materialization. Enum:'quality, quantity, reputation'  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity.

Not available the example of a Mitigation in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
#### Mitigation NGSI-LD key-values Example    
Here is an example of a Mitigation in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
